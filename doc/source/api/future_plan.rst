Future Plan
===========

This page outlines the planned features, improvements, and roadmap for the ongoing development of the project.

Short-Term Goals (Next 1–3 Months)
----------------------------------

- Isolate general-purpose utility modules into an independent PyPI project, making this repository more neuroscience-specific:

  - ``neuralib.argp``
  - ``neuralib.persistence``
  - ``neuralib.sqlp``

- Deprecate ``neuralib.atlas.ibl`` and integrate ``brainglobe-heatmap`` as its replacement.

Mid-Term Goals (3–6 Months)
---------------------------

- Migrate to Python ≥ 3.11 to support more recent dependencies and tooling.
- Expand the ``neuralib.ephys`` module to support in vivo electrophysiology data processing.

Community Involvement
---------------------

We welcome ideas, feature requests, and contributions from the community. If you’d like to get involved, feel free to:

- Open a GitHub issue for suggestions or feedback.
- Submit pull requests for proposed features and improvements.
